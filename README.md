# nutritionOS

nutritionOS defines how eating, cooking, and nutritional decisions become a **coherent, long-term process** rather than a sequence of isolated days.

Most nutrition tools focus on logging, scoring, and correcting. nutritionOS focuses on **continuity**: how food choices accumulate, stabilize, and make sense over time.

nutritionOS is part of **MetaMemoryWorks** — a file-based architecture for persistent AI memory.

## What is nutritionOS?

nutritionOS is a **nutrition and cooking system**, not a calorie app.

It turns a language model into something that can:

- remember what you eat,
- understand what you have at home,
- and reason about food as part of everyday life.

You define goals if you want to — maintenance, deficit, surplus, protein focus, recovery — but nutritionOS does not reduce eating to targets alone. It works with preferences, constraints, habits, and phases. nutritionOS is grounded in **your actual pantry**. You enter what you really have, once. From there, recipes, meals, and suggestions are built from reality, not from idealized shopping lists.

Over time, logs create context:
- what worked,
- what didn’t,
- what felt easy,
- what felt exhausting.

The system does not reset every morning. It remembers.

## What problem nutritionOS addresses

Most nutrition apps are episodic.

- You log a day.
- You see numbers.
- You miss a target.
- You compensate.
- You start again.

This produces discipline — and often fatigue.

nutritionOS treats nutrition as a **continuous process**. A bad day is not a failure. It is part of the curve. Instead of judging food, nutritionOS **organizes it**:

- across days,
- across weeks,
- across changing goals.

What emerges is not control, but orientation.

## Core characteristics

- Pantry-based reasoning (work with what is actually there)
- Recipe systems instead of one-off meal ideas
- Persistent logs that create context, not pressure
- Transparent calculations that remain inspectable
- No gamification, streaks, or moral scoring of food
- Designed to evolve with training, stress, and everyday life

nutritionOS does not try to motivate you.
It tries to stay coherent.

## What nutritionOS is **not**

nutritionOS deliberately avoids claims it cannot guarantee:

- Not a medical or therapeutic system
- Not a replacement for professional nutritional advice
- Not an enforcement or discipline tool

nutritionOS provides **structure and memory**. Decisions remain yours.

## How nutritionOS works in practice

nutritionOS operates across three layers:

**Pantry**  
Your ingredients are the base reality. Everything else derives from this.

**Recipes**  
Recipes are reusable structures that can be scaled, adjusted, and refined.
They are not inspiration fragments, but building blocks.

**Logs**  
Logs create continuity. Not to judge, but to reveal patterns over time.

This allows you to:
- build meals from what you already have
- scale food to daily needs without micromanagement
- understand satiety, energy, and habits longitudinally
- derive shopping needs from actual usage, not guesses

nutritionOS does not tell you what to eat.
It keeps the system intelligible while you live your life.

## Relation to MetaMemoryWorks

nutritionOS can be used standalone.

Within MetaMemoryWorks, it typically functions as:
- a persistent memory layer for nutrition and cooking
- a bridge between daily decisions and long-term patterns
- an upstream component for trainingOS, sleepOS, and related modules

nutritionOS does not require MetaMemoryWorks,
but integrates cleanly with it.

---

## Installation & usage

nutritionOS is distributed as a file package.

There is nothing to install and nothing to configure.
You upload the files into your LLM environment and begin.

Typical workflow:
1. Download and unzip nutritionOS
2. Upload all files into a new project
3. Follow the Start Guide
4. Enter your pantry (or adapt a preset)
5. Begin logging and cooking

Primarily tested with **ChatGPT Projects**.
Other LLMs should work as long as file context is supported.

## Versioning

nutritionOS follows semantic versioning.

Presets, pantries, and expansions may version independently.
